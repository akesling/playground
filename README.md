You can [try Artichoke in your browser](https://artichoke.run). The
[Artichoke Playground](https://github.com/artichoke/playground) runs a
[WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) build of
[Artichoke](https://github.com/artichoke/artichoke).

If you would prefer to run a local build of the playground, you can
[set up a Rust toolchain](/CONTRIBUTING.md#rust-toolchain) and a launch local
development server with:

```sh
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-emscripten
. scripts/install-emscripten-toolchain.sh
npm build
npm run dev:open
```

## Contributing

Artichoke aspires to be a Ruby 2.6.3-compatible implementation of the Ruby
programming language.
[There is lots to do](https://github.com/artichoke/artichoke/issues).

If the Artichoke Playground does not run Ruby source code in the same way that
MRI does, it is a bug and we would appreciate if you
[filed an issue so we can fix it](https://github.com/artichoke/playground/issues/new).

If you would like to contribute code üë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª, find an issue that looks interesting
and leave a comment that you're beginning to investigate. If there is no issue,
please file one before beginning to work on a PR.
